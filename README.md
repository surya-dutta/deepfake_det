# DeepFake Detection using MesoNet
Built a MesoNet-based deep learning model with residual blocks and an attention mechanism achieving 97% detection accuracy. 

Utilized pruning with 20% sparsity to improve generalization, and applied dimensionality reduction and feature engineering to 
enhance model performance, and integrated the model into a scalable deployment pipeline using Docker.
